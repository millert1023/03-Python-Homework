* In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. I was given a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, my company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
